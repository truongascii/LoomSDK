/**
 *  A Vector is an ordered collection of items where every item is of the same type.
 *
 *  * The base type can be any class, including built in classes and custom classes.
 *  * Vectors are dynamic (the number of items is allowed to change) unless the `setFixed` method is used to freeze the size.
 *  * Items will be initialized to `null` if a non-zero size is provided to the constructor.
 *  * When increasing the size of a Vector, the `push` or `unshift` methods must used. Assigning a value to an index beyond the final value will result in an out-of-bounds error.
 *
 *  Vectors can be instantiated via their constructor function, or with a literal syntax using square brackets (`[]`):
 *
 *  ```as3
 *  var v1:Vector.<String> = new Vector.<String>(26);
 *  v1[0] = 'a';
 *  v1[25] = 'z';
 *
 *  var v2:Vector.<String> = [ 'one', 'two', 'three' ];
 *  ```
 *
 *  Vector values are accessed via the square bracket operators (`[]`) and a zero-based index:
 *
 *  ```as3
 *  var m:String = v1[12];
 *  v2[1] = 'TWO';
 *  ```
 *
 *  Iteration over vectors can be done in several ways:
 *
 *  * with a `for` loop, for manual iteration
 *  * with a `for..in` loop, for iteration by index
 *  * with a `for each` loop, for iteration by value
 *  * using the callback iterators: `every()`, `filter()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, `some()`
 *
 *  ```as3
 *  var v:Vector.<String> = [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];
 *
 *  for (var i:Number = 0; i < v.length; i++) {
 *      trace('v[' + i +'] =', v[i]);
 *  }
 *
 *  for (var n:Number in v)
 *  {
 *      trace('v[' +n +'] =', v[n]);
 *  }
 *
 *  for each(var s:String in v) {
 *      trace(s);
 *  }
 *  ```
 *

 *  @see #filter()
 *  @see #forEach()
 *  @see #map()
 *  @see #some()
